In this problem I have used Random forest classifier for classification task as it is very flexible and produces powerful results with good accuracy as compared to SVM .Another reason 
for using random forests is that there are many features in this dataset.Age_upon_outcome_(days) is directly correlated with age_upon_outcome_(years).Hence i hae removed 
age_upon_outcome_(days),similarly i removed age_upon_intake_(days). Age_upon_intake is same as age_upon_intake(years) hence I removed age_upon_intake and age_upon_outcome.
I removed irrlevant features such as intake_datetime , outcome_datetime,intake_monthyear,outcome_monthyear.I filled null values with maximum occuring elements. I encoded the feature
values  using LabelEncoder() function .Then I tuned parameters such as n_estimators, max_depth ,max_features for Random Forest classifier by using cross validation .
